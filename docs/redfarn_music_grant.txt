Hello Ingo,

I am strictly non-commercial and am happy for others to use my music.
I won't accept money at any time.

I now understand that the GPL license would allow others commercial use under certain conditions.
I am prepared to accept that use, provided that I was still acknowledged as the composer / originator.
I definitely would not want any money deriving from any commercial enterprise.

I would not like to lose the right to edit my music, on my website, should I wish to do so.
I am assuming that the GPL license would not prevent me from doing this.
Please tell me if this is not the case.

All the pieces that your group have selected are entirely my own compositions, except for:

1. "Careless Love" This comes under the "traditional" category and is therefore in the public domain.

2, "Moo Moo Boogie" was partly inspired by "Cow Cow Boogie".
In my opinion,  Moo Moo Boogie  is sufficiently different from Cow Cow Boogie not to raise any copyright issues.
In any case, the composer of Cow Cow Boogie died 66 years ago so that composition is also out of copyright.

Thank you for your care.

Regards,

Jim

Dear Ingo,

Apologies.
I should also have said that "Big Man Boogie" is derived from a piece called "Clockwork Boogie"
by Steve Clayton (who lives in Germany).
However, I did write to Steve and he gave permission.

Regards,

Jim
